It is well known fact that every time you start learning a new programming language you start with a "Hello World" program.

As blogging for me is something completely new, I will start my journey with a Hello World post :)

What?
=====

I just want a place to write down some thoughts about my daily work. Nothing fancy.

How?
====

This simple blog serves a platform to store all that information I want to publish without hassels.

Why?
====

A blog seems to be a optimal option, as it allows me to share and contribute back to the community. Also, it will help to promote my professional career.
